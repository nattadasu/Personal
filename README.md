        <h1>Hi and welcome to my "repo" >w<)/</h1>
        <p>I creating this repo is for ehm.... Marks any project(s) that I contributed to...</p>
        <p>Plus, I'm kinda tired to creating my own website (<a href="https://natsutadama.weebly.com">here</a> and also <a href="https://endemic-kun.weebly.com">here</a>). So, here is it, my "solution" about that :v</p>

    <body>
        <h2>Well....</h2>
        <p>Because sometimes I can't speak in English fluently, then I made this repo in Multilingual (yep, I can understand in some languages fyi).</p>
